# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

-- What are the top 10 artist by popularity?

Select artist_name, popularity
From spotifydata
Order by popularity desc
Limit 10;

-- What song has the highest danceability?

Select track_name, max(danceability)
From spotifydata;

-- What are the top 10 most popular songs with energy at least .8 or more?

Select track_name, artist_name, popularity, energy
From spotifydata
Where energy >= .8
Order by popularity desc
Limit 10;

-- What artist released the longest song?

Select artist_name, Max(duration_ms)
From spotifydata;

--What are the average popularity, danceability, and energy of the artists?

Select artist_name, 
avg(popularity), 
avg(danceability), 
avg(energy) 
From Spotifydata
Group by artist_name, track_name;
