#Here is a project I did with a dataset from a digital media store and it includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.
I answered 17 questions using this dataset.

-- 1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").
Select FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
From chinook.customers 
Where Country <> 'US';

-- 2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
Select *
From chinook.customers
Where Country = 'Brazil';

-- 3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
Select cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
From chinook.customers cust
Join chinook.invoices inv
On cust.customerId = inv.customerId
Where BillingCountry = 'Brazil';

-- 4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
Select * from chinook.employees
Where Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

-- 5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
Select Distinct BillingCountry
From chinook.invoices;

-- 6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
Select emp.LastName, emp.FirstName, inv.InvoiceId
From chinook.employees emp
Join chinook.customers cust 
On cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
Join chinook.invoices inv
On inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

-- 7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
Select e.FirstName AS 'SR First Name',
e.LastName AS 'SR Last Name',
c.FirstName AS 'Customer First Name', 
c.LastName AS 'Customer Last Name', 
c.Country, 
i.Total
From employees e
Join customers c
On c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId

Join invoices i
On i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId; 

-- 8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
Select Count(*)
From chinook.invoices
Where InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

-- 9. What are the total sales for 2009?
Select SUM(Total) 
From chinook.invoices
Where InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

-- 10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
Select tracks.Name, inv.InvoiceLineID
From tracks 
Join invoice_items inv
On inv.TrackId = tracks.TrackId;

-- 11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
Select ar.Name AS Artist, t.Name AS Track, i.InvoiceLineId 
From chinook.invoice_items i

Left Join chinook.tracks t
On i.TrackID = t.TrackId

Inner Join chinook.albums a
On a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId

Left Join chinook.artists ar
On ar.ArtistId = a.ArtistId;

-- 12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
Select t.Name AS Track, a.Title as Album, m.Name AS 'Media Type', g.Name AS Genre
From tracks t
Join albums a
On t.AlbumId = a.AlbumId

Join media_types m
On m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId

Join genres g
On g.GenreId = t.GenreId;

-- 13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
Select e.FirstName, e.LastName, 
Round(Sum(i.Total),2) as 'Total Sales'
From employees e

Join customers c
On c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId

Join invoices i
On i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId

Where e.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
Group by e.FirstName;

-- 14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
Select e.FirstName, e.LastName,
Round(Sum(i.Total),2) as 'Total Sales'
From employees e

Join customers c
On c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId

Join invoices i
On i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId

Where e.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
AND i.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'
Group by e.FirstName
Order by (Round(Sum(i.Total),2)) DESC
LIMIT 1;


-- Q1 ~ What is the country with the highest sales?
Select round(sum(total),2), billingcountry
From invoices
Group by billingcountry
Order by (round(sum(total),2)) desc
Limit 1;


-- Q2 ~ What genres were billed in the USA?
Select g.Name AS Genre, i.billingcountry
From genres g
Join invoices i
On i.invoiceId = g.genreId
Where billingcountry = 'USA'
Group by g.name;

-- Q3 ~ What tracks are under the rock genre?
Select t.name AS 'Track Name', 
a.name as 'Artist Name', 
al.Title AS Album,
g.Name AS Genre
From tracks t
Join albums al
On al.AlbumId = t.AlbumId

Join genres g
On g.GenreId = t.GenreId

Join artists a
On al.ArtistId = a.ArtistId

Where g.name = 'Rock';
